Squared
=======

The final project for my Processing class at the University of Florida.

This is a simple platforming/puzzle game containing 6 short stages, 2 endings,
and maybe an easter egg or two. (If you try entering a well-known code...)

To play the game, please download the "Executable" folder, and run Squared.bat.
